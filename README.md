# 💻 clcltr: A Simple Web Calculator

A clean, responsive, and functional calculator implemented using modern web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). This project provides a basic but essential tool for performing quick arithmetic calculations directly in the browser.

## ✨ Features

The `clcltr` application focuses on simplicity and ease of use, providing the fundamental tools necessary for day-to-day calculations.

* **Basic Arithmetic:** Supports standard operations: Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), and Division (`/`).
* **Square Root Functionality:** Includes a button for calculating the square root of a number ($\sqrt{x}$).
* **Clear Functions:** A "Clear Entry" (CE) button to erase the current input, and an "All Clear" (AC) button to reset the entire calculation state.
* **Decimal Support:** Allows calculations involving non-integer values.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized layout for use on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

This project is a purely front-end application built with the core web technologies:

* **HTML5:** Structure and content of the application.
* **CSS3:** Styling and layout, ensuring a visually appealing and organized interface.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Core logic for handling button presses, performing calculations, and updating the display.
